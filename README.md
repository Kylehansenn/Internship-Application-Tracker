#Internship Tracker

A program that takes in a job posting URL and pulls information like company name, location, and position title. This information is then updated in a excel spreadsheet. The overall concept should work like an application where you upload your resume and it tries to full out your information in the right sections. It is similar in the way that it will try its best to find and enter the right information otherwise will leave it blank. You can always changed the value before submitting to update the excel spreadsheet.
